# Build the macOS production app, launch it, capture a per-tab screenshot
# of just the SmartCrab window via `screencapture -l`, and quit.
#
# Mac counterpart of `preview-sim.sh` (which is iOS-only via serve-sim).
# `serve-sim` works against `simctl io`'s framebuffer and has no macOS
# equivalent; we instead drive the live app through System Events for
# clicks and use `screencapture -l <window-id>` for capture.

# Usage: ./scripts/e2e/preview-mac.sh [debug|release]
