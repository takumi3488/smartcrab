# SmartCrab Documentation

SmartCrab is a macOS desktop application implementing the "Tool-to-AI" paradigm. Non-AI processing runs first, and conditional branches in a YAML pipeline decide whether to invoke an AI agent (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, or pi.dev — resolved at runtime by `seher-ts`).

The application is split into a SwiftUI host process and a Bun TypeScript service that communicate over line-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 on stdio.

## How to Read the Documentation

| Category | Content | Audience |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **design/** | Why & How — process model, execution engine, routing, learning loop | Readers who want to understand the architecture |

## Legacy

The previous Tauri/Rust framework documentation (Layer / DTO / DirectedGraphBuilder, tokio runtime, OpenTelemetry exporter, `crab new` CLI) lives under [`content/legacy/`](content/legacy/) for reference. **It does not describe the current implementation.**
